# Semantic Memory

**Semantic Memory** is an open-source library and service specializing in the
efficient indexing of datasets through custom continuous data pipelines.

Utilizing advanced embeddings and LLMs, the system enables natural language
querying for obtaining answers from the indexed data, complete with citations
and links to the original sources.

Designed for seamless integration with
[Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel),
Semantic Memory enhances data-driven features in applications built using SK.
